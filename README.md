# Phantm2_Bot
My second discord bot written in python using discord.py and a lot of code spliced from tutorials using json to store some data  

this is a WIP still  
but to use it for yourself you will need to have a python interpreter, install discord.py package on it then go into the Phantm2BotBase.py  
find owner_id=YOUR DISCORD ID NUMBER HERE, and replace the text in caps with your discord ID number (line 18)
find bot.run('YOUR TOKEN HERE', bot=True, reconnect=True), and replace the text in caps with the token you have generated for your discord bot (line 47)
